# Libft
Libft is a School 42 project.
At school, students are not allowed to use C library functions (such as `strcat`, `atoi`, `bzero` etc.). The task is to recreate various standard C library functions.

[`libft.en.pdf`](/libft.en.pdf) is the task file.

Allowed functions are `malloc` `free` & `write`. Everything else is forbidden for the mandatory submission.

### Compiling
To compile, run `make`. This will produce a `libft.a` library which you can link to your project.
